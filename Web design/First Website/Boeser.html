<h2 class="a"><li>Biography </li></h2>
<p>Brock Boeser (/ˈbɛsər/; German pronunciation: [ˈbœsɐ]; born February 25, 1997) is an American professional ice hockey player currently playing for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). A top prospect with the Waterloo Black Hawks of the United States Hockey League (USHL), Boeser was selected 23rd overall in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft by the Canucks, and spent the following two seasons with the University of North Dakota. He made his NHL debut in 2017 with Vancouver. Internationally, Boeser has played for the United States national junior team at the 2016 World Junior Championships, where he helped the team win a bronze medal.  </p>

<h2 class="a"><li> Playing Career (Amateur)</li></h2>
<p>
During the 2014–15 season, Boeser led the league with 35 goals and was named to both the 2014–15 USHL All-Rookie Team and First All-Star Team. In 2015–16 Boeser represented Team USA in the IIHF under-20 championships, as the team took bronze overall. During the 2015–16 season playing for the University of North Dakota he was fourth, sixth, and third in goals (27), assists (33) and points (60) respectively in division I hockey, the same season he helped the team win the NCAA Division I National Championship. He missed two months of the 2016–17 season due to a wrist injury. </p>

<h2 class="a"><li> Playing Career (Professional) </li></h2>
<p>Boeser was selected 23rd overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. He signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Canucks on March 25, 2017. Later that same day, he made his NHL debut in his home state of Minnesota and scored his first NHL goal in the 4–2 win.
On November 4, 2017, Boeser scored a hat trick, the first Canucks player age 20 or younger to do so since Trevor Linden on December 20, 1990 as well as the third youngest behind Trevor Linden and Tony Tanti. All three goals came against Matt Murray of the Pittsburgh Penguins, allowing the Canucks to win 4–2.
Boeser was named the league's Rookie of the Month for November after leading all skaters (not just rookies) with 11 goals in 15 games. He was again named Rookie of the Month for the month of December after scoring 8 goals and 13 points in 13 games. On January 10, 2018, Boeser was named to his first career NHL All-Star Game as a member of the Pacific Division roster. With two goals and an assist in two games, Boeser was named the Most Valuable Player of the 2018 NHL All-Star Game becoming the first rookie to do so since Mario Lemieux in 1985. Boeser also won the 2018 accuracy shooting contest, hitting all five targets in a time of 11.136 seconds. Boeser was injured in a game against the New York Islanders on March 5, 2018, when he collided with Cal Clutterbuck and the Canucks bench. It was later reported he suffered a back injury and would miss 4–6 weeks to recover. At the time of his injury, he led the team in goals, points, shots on goal, and power-play points. Despite missing the final 16 games of the season, Boeser was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy which is awarded to the league's best rookie of the year. The award was ultimately won by New York Islanders centre Mathew Barzal.
Boeser recovered from his injury enough to join the Canucks for the 2018–19 season. He played 13 games and collected 11 points, despite injuring his groin in a game against the Winnipeg Jets on October 18. After missing two games in November due to his groin injury, Boeser was sent back to Vancouver to be examined by a specialist while the team was on a road trip. After being assigned to the injury reserve for 11 games, Boeser was assigned back to the roster on November 27. On December 9, Boeser scored his second career hat-trick, doing so in a 6–1 win over the St. Louis Blues.
On September 16, 2019, following the expiry of his entry-level contract after the previous season, Boeser signed a three-year, $17.625 million contract to remain with Vancouver. On October 30, in a 5–3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, Boeser scored his third career hat-trick.</p>
