<h2 class="a"><li>Biography </li></h2>
<p> Bowie William Horvat (born April 5, 1995) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre currently serving as captain for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). </p>

<p>He was selected ninth overall in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. During his junior career in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), he won the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as playoff MVP in 2013, as well as two J. Ross Robertson Cup titles with the London Knights. Internationally, he has played for Team Canada at the 2012 World U-17 Hockey Challenge, 2012 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament (under-18), 2014 IIHF U20 Championships and the 2018 IIHF World Championship.</p> 



<h2 class="a"><li> Early Life</li></h2>
<p>Horvat was born in London, Ontario, to Tim and Cindy Horvat. His father is a former hockey player who also played major junior with the London Knights, while his younger brother, Cal, also plays hockey. He grew up in Rodney, Ontario, which is approximately 50 kilometres away from London, a farming town with a population of about 1,000. In an interview with his parents, Tim stated that he originally wanted to name Horvat "Bo" after Bo Jackson and Bo Schembechler; however, Cindy stated that she did not want to name Horvat just "Bo". The couple eventually decided to name Horvat "Bowie," since Cindy was a big fan of David Bowie.
Upon his NHL draft, the town hosted a celebratory event for him at West Elgin Arena, his childhood minor hockey arena, and was reportedly attended by more than 1,000 people. As a child, Horvat cheered for the Detroit Red Wings. He has also listed Mike Richards as one of his favourite players growing up. 
At age four, Horvat played for The West Lorne Comets. At age 12, Horvat played peewee for the Toronto Red Wings, winning the all-Ontario Peewee AAA championships in 2008. With ten points in the round-robin portion of the tournament, he won the leading scorer award. Living more than 200 kilometres away from Toronto, Horvat was driven into the city every weekend by a teammate's father and practised separately from the team throughout the week.
By 2010, Horvat advanced to the midget level with the Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs. He scored 47 goals and 118 points over 68 games in his first and only season with the team and was named the Minor Hockey Alliance of Ontario's midget player of the year.[11] At the end of the season, he played an additional five games of Junior B for the St. Thomas Stars, a team coached and owned by his uncle, Ron Horvat (Horvat's father also helped out with the team). During his brief stint with St. Thomas, he registered a goal and four points.  </p>

<h2 class="a"><li> Playing Career (London Knights) </li></h2>
<p>In the summer following his midget season, Horvat was selected 9th overall by the London Knights in the 2011 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection Draft. Joining the Knights for the 2011–12 season, he scored a goal in his OHL debut on September 23, 2011, an 8-0 win over the Saginaw Spirit. Horvat completed his OHL rookie season with 11 goals and 30 points in 64 games, ranking 18th among the league's first-year players. In the playoffs, he contributed a goal and three assists over 18 games, as London won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as league champions. With the Knights advancing to the 2012 Memorial Cup, Horvat scored a goal in three games. London finished as tournament runner-up to the Shawinigan Cataractes, losing 2–1 in the final. 
In 2012–13, Horvat improved to 33 goals and 61 points over 67 games, ranking fourth in team scoring. As part of the OHL's annual coaches poll, he was voted as the league's best in faceoffs and shot blocking. He was also recognized for his academic efforts as the Knights' representative on the OHL Scholastic Team. In the post-season, Horvat added 16 goals and 23 points in 21 playoff games, helping the Knights defend their OHL championship. In the deciding game of the finals, Horvat scored twice, including the game-winner with less than a second remaining. Leading the league in playoff goals, Horvat was given the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as the post-season's most valuable player. Advancing to the 2013 Memorial Cup, the Knights finished as semifinalists, losing to the Portland Winterhawks 2–1. Horvat recorded two goals and five points in five games. With zero penalty minutes, he was named the tournament's Most Sportsmanlike Player.
Entering the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, Horvat was ranked 15th among North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, while International Scouting Services ranked him 10th overall among all draft-eligible skaters. He was scouted as a two-way forward who could contribute in all areas of the game, both offensively and defensively. When asked to compare himself to an NHL player, Horvat stated that he tries to model his game after Mike Richards, a Selke Trophy nominee in previous years. Horvat was taken ninth overall in the draft by the Vancouver Canucks, who had traded goaltender Cory Schneider in exchange for the draft pick.
While attending Canada's national junior summer camp, Horvat was signed to a three-year, entry level contract on August 6, 2013.[ Following his first training camp and pre-season with the Canucks, Horvat appeared to have made the team's opening roster. After the Canucks made a trade for a pair of centres from the Carolina Hurricanes, however, he was reassigned to the OHL for another season of junior.
Returning to London for his third OHL season, Horvat was often rumoured by the media to succeed Scott Harrington as the Knights' next team captain. The decision ultimately went to forward Chris Tierney, while Horvat was selected as an alternate. Playing in 54 games, Horvat recorded a career-high 74 points (30 goals and 44 assists), ranking third in team scoring to Max Domi and Tierney. He added 5 goals and 11 points in 9 playoff games, as the Knights were eliminated in the second round. </p>
